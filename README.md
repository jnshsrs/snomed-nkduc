## SNOMED CT Mapping of the NKDUC

This site is contains additional information about our mapping project, in which we linked clinical concepts of a natioanlly consented dataset for the record keeping of patients with leg ulcer (NKDUC) with the international terminology SNOMED CT.

On this site, we provide the cross-map, which is the pairwise link between the source concepts of the national dataset and SNOMED CT concepts, and the complete analysis of the reliability and the coverage rate of the mapping.

## Cross-Map

The cross-map is available as a csv-file, which can be joined with the reference table of the source dataset (NKDUC) that is also available as csv file.

## Coverage Rate and Reliability Analysis

The coverage rate and reliability analysis is available in a python notebook.

**Note:** Additionally, we provide the same analysis as in R which can be found [here](https://jnshsrs.github.io/snomed-nkduc/results-mapping.html).
